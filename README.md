# SQL-Project-Data-Analysis-of-Fraudulent-Transactions

# Summary
In visual_data_analysis.ipynb I use SQL and python to graph and look for evidence of fraudulent transactions/ outlier purchases. In challenge.ipynb I create 2 algorithms that identifies outliers in a list. 
# Results
The anomalies are all purchases of 100s or 1000s of dollars. All other (normal) purchases are around $20 or less.
